## Uber-Weather-Project

This repository contains the analysis, conclusions, and proposals developed by Group 9 (Mahsa, Emily, Jesus) for Project 1.

### Overview

The repository includes the following components:

1. **NYC Uber Pickup Data Analysis**
   - An analysis of New York City (NYC) Uber pickup data during the first six months of 2015, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and insights generation.
   - Details on data sources, analysis procedures, and instructions for running the analysis script.

2. **Project Analysis and Conclusion**
   - Detailed analyses and conclusions for different aspects of the project, including pickup patterns, holiday vs. regular day analysis, weather impact on pickups, and more.
   - Each analysis is accompanied by code snippets, visualizations, and interpretations.

3. **Project Proposals**
   - Proposals for further analysis, addressing questions such as the impact of weather conditions on Uber pickups, correlations between weather variables and pickups, and more.
   - Detailed instructions and insights for conducting proposed analyses.

### Data Sources

The analysis primarily utilizes the following dataset:

- `uber_nyc_enriched.csv`: Contains NYC Uber pickup data, including information such as date and time of pickup, borough, number of pickups, weather-related data (speed, visibility, temperature, dew point, sea level pressure, precipitation, snow depth), and a holiday indicator.

### Data Cleaning

#### Overview

The data cleaning process involves ensuring data quality and preparing the dataset for further analysis.

#### Steps:

1. **Data Loading and Initial Examination:**
   - Load the CSV file `uber_nyc_enriched.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Display information about the columns in the DataFrame.

2. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Drop rows with missing values in the "borough" column.
   - Convert the data type of the "pickup_dt" column from "object" to "datetime64".

3. **Holiday Data Handling:**
   - Update the "hday" column to include weekends as holidays.
   - Mark specified dates as holidays in the dataset.

4. **Temperature Conversion:**
   - Convert temperature data from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

5. **Data Export:**
   - Save the cleaned and processed data to a new CSV file named `clean.csv` for future analysis.

### Analysis Overview

#### Q1: NYC Uber Pickup Patterns Analysis

In this analysis, we delve into the intricate patterns of Uber pickups in New York City during the first six months of 2015. We start by loading the cleaned dataset and meticulously preparing it for analysis. The data preparation phase involves converting timestamps, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity. Once the data is ready, we embark on a journey to uncover the temporal and spatial dynamics of Uber pickups.

##### Detailed Steps:
1. **Data Loading and Preparation:**
   - Load the cleaned dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Convert timestamps to datetime objects for time-based analysis.
   - Handle missing values and ensure data consistency.

2. **Temporal Analysis:**
   - Analyze hourly and daily pickup patterns to understand peak hours and daily trends.
   - Explore how pickup rates vary between holidays and regular days.

3. **Spatial Analysis:**
   - Investigate pickup patterns by borough to identify geographical hotspots.
   - Compare pickup trends across different boroughs to understand spatial variations.

4. **Visualization and Interpretation:**
   - Visualize pickup patterns using charts, graphs, and heatmaps.
   - Interpret the findings to extract meaningful insights into Uber pickup behavior in NYC.

#### Q2: Analysis and Conclusion

In this analysis, we focus on understanding the relationship between population density and Uber pickup rates in New York City. By comparing pickup rates per day and per capita across different boroughs, we aim to uncover any correlations between population density and pickup demand. Additionally, we investigate how pickup rates fluctuate between holidays and regular days to identify any temporal variations in pickup behavior.

##### Detailed Steps:
1. **Population and Pickup Rates Comparison:**
   - Compare pickup rates per day and per capita across different boroughs.
   - Analyze the relationship between population density and pickup demand.

2. **Holiday vs. Regular Day Analysis:**
   - Examine pickup rates during holidays and regular days to understand temporal variations.
   - Investigate any differences in pickup behavior between holiday and non-holiday periods.

3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Explore correlations between population density and pickup rates to identify any significant relationships.
   - Analyze the impact of population density on Uber pickup demand in different areas of NYC.

#### Q3: Analysis and Conclusion

This analysis focuses on exploring the impact of holidays on Uber pickup rates and analyzing geospatial patterns of pickups by borough in New York City. By examining pickup trends during holidays and regular days, we aim to understand how holiday periods influence pickup behavior. Additionally, we conduct geospatial analysis to identify any spatial variations in pickup distribution across different boroughs.

##### Detailed Steps:
1. **Holiday Pickup Analysis:**
   - Compare pickup rates between holidays and regular days to assess the impact of holidays on pickup behavior.
   - Analyze any differences in pickup trends during holiday periods.

2. **Geospatial Analysis:**
   - Investigate pickup distribution across different boroughs to identify geographical hotspots.
   - Explore spatial variations in pickup behavior and identify areas with high pickup demand.

3. **Visualization and Interpretation:**
   - Visualize pickup patterns using geospatial maps, charts, and graphs.
   - Interpret the findings to extract insights into the temporal and spatial dynamics of Uber pickups in NYC.

#### Q4: Analysis and Conclusion

In this analysis, we delve into the correlations between weather conditions and Uber pickup rates in New York City. By examining how weather variables such as temperature, precipitation, and snow depth influence pickup demand, we aim to uncover insights into the impact of weather on Uber pickups. Additionally, we conduct regression analysis to assess the strength and significance of these correlations.

##### Detailed Steps:
1. **Weather and Pickup Rate Correlation Analysis:**
   - Explore correlations between weather variables and pickup rates to identify significant relationships.
   - Analyze how weather conditions influence pickup demand and behavior.

2. **Regression Analysis:**
   - Conduct regression analysis to assess the strength and significance of correlations between weather variables and pickup rates.
   - Determine the predictive power of weather variables in explaining variations in pickup demand.

3. **Visualization and Interpretation:**
   - Visualize correlations and regression results using charts, graphs, and heatmaps.
   - Interpret the findings to extract insights into the impact of weather on Uber pickup behavior in NYC.
